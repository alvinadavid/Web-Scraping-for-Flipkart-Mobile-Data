# Web-Scraping-for-Flipkart-Mobile-Data
This project is an end-to-end web scraping pipeline that extracts detailed mobile phone product data from Flipkart, a popular e-commerce site. It demonstrates the complete workflow from scraping raw HTML data to storing structured records in a MongoDB database and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the collected data.
